# CudaSobelFilter
A showcase of the Sobel Filter in CUDA and OpenCV
I have made an implementation of the Sobel filter with the help of [lukas783's public repository](https://github.com/lukas783/CUDA-Sobel-Filter.git).
Next to them I've made an auto resizer and scaler so that most images can be converted and showcased on a 1920x1080 monitor.
This program does not output an image, just shows how it works. I've screenshotted every output if someone only wants to look at that.




This Project was Created with Visual Studio.
You can use the .sln file to open the whole project, where you can build and run the app automatically.
I have put 4 images into the folders, so you can test it out, just remember to change the input file's name.
